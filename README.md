# ‚ú®üß† Neuromorphic Computing meets Reinforcement Learning: A Hands-On Workshop ü§ñ‚ú®

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Welcome to this hands-on workshop exploring the exciting intersection of **Neuromorphic Computing (NC)** and **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**!

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook (`neuro-1.ipynb`) which will guide you through the fundamental concepts of both fields, culminating in a practical project where we combine them. We focus on intuitive explanations, the underlying mathematical ideas, and practical coding examples using Python.

**No prior knowledge of NC or RL is strictly required**, just some basic Python programming experience.
